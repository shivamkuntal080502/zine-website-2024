          And the journey startsðŸ˜€. Letâ€™s start with some conceptual things. So
          in this blog, we will study circuit elements. What are these and where
          do we see them in daily life and robotics?ðŸ¤” (Remove all the

          But before starting with circuit elements, do you know what a circuit
          is? A circuit is an arrangement of individual electronic components,
          such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes,
          connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current
          can flow. Now letâ€™s understand this with a hypothetical activity.
        </p>

        <p>1. Required elements:</p>

        <p>
          In case you have your real-world LED, switch, battery, and wires, they
          will work better, but if you donâ€™t have them, you can take these
          hypothetical ones. Assume them to be similar to the real-world ones.

          <div className="col-span-10">
            <p>
              2. Now, you need to connect a piece of wire to each terminal of
              LED and analyze whether it is a circuit according to the
              definition. Is it a circuit? No, itâ€™s not because it does not make
              a closed path. (The one in red is the positive terminal and the
              one in black is negative)

            <p>
              Now, connect the end terminals of wire extending from the
              terminals of LED and connect them. Is it a circuit now? Even
              though you have closed the loop, it cannot be called an electric
              circuit because of the absence of the flow of electric current
              since the power source is absent. So, you need to add a power
              source.

            <br />
            <p>
              4. Disconnect the wire ends from each other and connect them to
              the battery in a way that the wire from the longer terminal of the
              LED connects to the positive terminal of the battery and that from
              the shorter terminal of the LED must connect to the negative
              terminal of the battery.

            <p>
              Youâ€™ll notice that your LED will start to glow, and voila! Youâ€™ve
              created your very first circuit. Now you must be wondering why we
              needed the switch to demonstrate about circuits, we donâ€™t really.
              Our elementary electric circuit is now complete. But we need a
              switch to illustrate some more concepts.

              Suppose you connect a switch in series with your circuit, but the
              simple on/off switch can only have two states, on or off, and
              takes only one of them at once.

          A quick question - would the arrangement still be called a circuit if
          I set the switch in the OFF state? There is no flow of electric
          current, so it defies the definition of a circuit. Try and think by
          yourself! If it is, why? Consider this as an assignment to yourself.

          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Resistor</h1>
          <p className="mb-8">
            The resistor is the most common and well-known passive element in
            any circuit. Just like the name suggests, the job of a resistor is
            to resist. A resistor restricts the flow of current to a certain
            level. In real life, the electric equipment that we use contains a
            high resistance because, at a lower resistance, it would burn out.
            This behavior of resisting the current is the main function of a
            resistor.

        <p className="mt-8">
          A resistor works on the principle of Ohmâ€™s Law. Ohmâ€™s Law states that
          the current through a conductor between two points is directly
          proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the
          constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual
          mathematical equation that describes this relationship:
        </p>

        <div className="border-2 border-solid border-black p-4 text-center my-8">
          <p className="text-3xl">V = I.R</p>
          <p>
            where I is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V
            is the voltage measured across the conductor in units of volts, and
            R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="text-center">

        <p className="my-8">
          If we apply a high enough voltage to a conductor, current will flow
          through it. The higher the voltage, the more current will flow. The
          more current flows, the more the conductor will heat up. If we
          continue to apply high enough voltage, the conductor will heat up to
          the point where it burns. This is what happens in a light bulb. The
          filament inside the bulb is a thin conductor. When we apply a high
          enough voltage to it, the filament heats up to the point where it
          glows, producing light. This is the principle behind all incandescent
          light bulbs.

        </div>

        <p className="mt-8">
          This behavior of heating up and burning out is what limits the amount
          of current that can flow through a conductor. The higher the
          resistance of the conductor, the more it will resist the flow of
          current. The lower the resistance, the more current will flow. This is
          why resistors are used in circuits to limit the amount of current that
          can flow. By choosing a resistor with the appropriate resistance, we
          can control the amount of current that flows through a circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resistance of a resistor is measured in ohms. The symbol for ohms
          is Î©. The resistance of a resistor is determined by the material it is
          made of and its physical dimensions. The resistance of a resistor is
          constant over a wide range of voltages and currents. This makes
          resistors very useful for controlling the amount of current that flows
          through a circuit.
