          And the journey startsðŸ˜€. Letâ€™s start with some conceptual things. So
          in this blog, we will study circuit elements. What are these and where
          do we see them in daily life and robotics?ðŸ¤” (Remove all the

          But before starting with circuit elements, do you know what a circuit
          is? A circuit is an arrangement of individual electronic components,
          such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes,
          connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current
          can flow. Now letâ€™s understand this with a hypothetical activity.

        <p>1. Required elements:</p>

          In case you have your real-world LED, switch, battery, and wires, they
          will work better, but if you donâ€™t have them, you can take these
          hypothetical ones. Assume them to be similar to the real-world ones.

            <p>
              2. Now, you need to connect a piece of wire to each terminal of
              LED and analyze whether it is a circuit according to the
              definition. Is it a circuit? No, itâ€™s not because it does not make
              a closed path. (The one in red is the positive terminal and the
              one in black is negative)

            <p>
              Now, connect the end terminals of wire extending from the
              terminals of LED and connect them. Is it a circuit now? Even
              though you have closed the loop, it cannot be called an electric
              circuit because of the absence of the flow of electric current
              since the power source is absent. So, you need to add a power
              source.

            <p>
              4. Disconnect the wire ends from each other and connect them to
              the battery in a way that the wire from the longer terminal of the
              LED connects to the positive terminal of the battery and that from
              the shorter terminal of the LED must connect to the negative
              terminal of the battery.

              Youâ€™ll notice that your LED will start to glow, and voila! Youâ€™ve
              created your very first circuit. Now you must be wondering why we
              needed the switch to demonstrate about circuits, we donâ€™t really.
              Our elementary electric circuit is now complete. But we need a
              switch to illustrate some more concepts.

              Suppose you connect a switch in series with your circuit, but the

          A quick question - would the arrangement still be called a circuit if
          I set the switch in the OFF state? There is no flow of electric
          current, so it defies the definition of a circuit. Try and think by
          yourself! If it is, why? Consider this as an assignment to yourself.

              Letâ€™s start with resistors. As the name suggests, it resists the
              current flow in the circuit. Suppose, you have 5 tubes of cold
              drinks, all empty and of similar capacity. Now fill them with 1,
              2, 3, 4, and 5 pebbles respectively and cover the tops with a
              paper having a single hole of the size of a pebble. Now pour the
              water in the tubes at similar rates for similar times. What do you
              observe? The amount of water collected in the container below each
              tube is different. The amount of water collected below the tube
              having a smaller number of pebbles is larger than the amount
              collected in the tube having a larger number of pebbles.
              Hypothetically, the number of pebbles in the tubes is similar to
              the amount of resistance each resistor offers. Higher resistance
              will allow less current to pass through it. Letâ€™s end this
              hypothetical example here because if someone asks you, what a
              resistor is, it should be something like:

                Transistors are active components and are used to amplify or
                switch electronic signals. They have three terminals: the
                emitter, base, and collector. The small current flowing through
                the base controls the larger current flowing between the
                collector and emitter. Transistors are the building blocks of
                modern electronic devices.
